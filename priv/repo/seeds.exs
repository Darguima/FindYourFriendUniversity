~S"""
This script will load all the files at ./seeds/ folder that match the expected naming pattern and use them to seed the DB.

## File Naming

In order to the script know what is loading, the files inside ./seeds/ need to follow a correct naming.

  - DGES applications files -> applications_*.json

## Running

Since this is the default Ecto seeding script

> mix ecto.setup
